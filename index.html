<h1>Valley Forge</h1>
<h2>Would You have Quit?</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>In the words of Thomas Paine,”These are the times that try men’s souls.”</p>
<p>The place is Valley Forge. The year is 1778. The situation is dire.</p>
<p>The question is: Will I re-enlist in the Continental American Army for another 9 months? Or, will I quit and never come back?</p>
<p>I have decided to re-enlist for three reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, What happens if I'm found out by the British as a rebel supporter?</p>
<p>Secondly, they need all the help and inspiration they can get.</p>
<p>Thirdly, This is, and always will be, the revolution’s darkest hour.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The first reason I reenlist will be that the British will tax us so much that I and many of my friends will be bankrupt.</p>
<p>No money means no food, no house, and no clothing.</p>
<p>I get all of that here for free.</p>
<p>Even though the supplies here are bad quality, they are better than no quality.</p>
<p>Besides, If the British ever find out that I am a rebel supporter, they will kill me, army member or not.</p>
<p>The camps here are protected.</p>
<p>I have a better chance in here than anywhere else as long as I don’t join the 4,000(a) people who are sick.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>he second reason is that, if enough people reenlist, others will see their friends reenlist and think that they should reenlist.They need young men like me to have the patience to stay and inspire others to enlist as well.We shall never give up. Bad things always happen. But bad things are only bad until they are overcome. We are here to overcome bad things. We can’t overcome bad things by leaving and making more bad things. We are men, not sunshine soldiers!</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The third and final reason that I have decided to reenlist is that this is the war’s darkest hour. The army needs help. 4,000 are sick and 1,800 are dead(a). But there is always a solution. For instance, we need more doctors. So, we go to the Congressional Committee. There is no possible way that leaving the army could help. Everything has a solution. If you can’t find it, you aren’t looking hard enough.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>So, will I quit? Absolutely not. Everything always works out in the end. Whether you are there to see it and get a reward from it is your problem. But Always have hope and never give up. This question is significant because if the soldiers were asked this question and considered both sides, then more of them may have stayed.Maybe, if the soldiers had decided to consider BOTH sides of the problem, the many people who left Valley Forge may have never left at all!
